In this project we are designing around USB wall socket charger. The affordance we use is the charger's affordances to be plugged into and plugged on to. We designed 2 objects to correspond with the two ends of the charger. The idea is to create a coherent sculptural objects that featuring the charger. We use the charger as mediator of the two pieces. We started with my object in red, a more rounded shapes, then the shape translated into a more angular object after "going through" the charger. The charger represents both rounded(organic) and angular, more cubic shape.
